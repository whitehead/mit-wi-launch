## What if I don't have an MIT Account?

### Whitehead Institute Affiliated
You can sign up for one and HR will sponsor you. Please start the process
by filling out the [MIT Account Request Form](https://it.wi.mit.edu/forms/mit-account-request)

### Independent Collaborator
We also have a limited number of invites for non-MIT affiliates. Members can sponsor independent collaborators. If you are interested in joining, please email us at mit-wi-launch@wi.mit.edu
