After that it should redirect offer for you to download the slack app or open it if it is already installed.

# See the MIT slack workspace

When you're in the slack app it will appear that you're in a general MIT slack, and you are. The WI Launch slack is a workspace within that larger Slack Enterprise-Grid.

By default, all the channels from all the mit workspaces you belong to will be displayed all together. You can use the dropdown to filter the channel list to just a specific workspace.
