This is a slack community to connect MIT biologists and computer scientists to further basic biological research using computational methods. We are a group of researchers, students, and enthusiasts who are interested in the intersection of biology and computer science. We are open to all levels of expertise and backgrounds. We are here to learn from each other, share resources, and collaborate on projects. We are also here to provide support and mentorship to those who are new to the field. We are a community of learners, and we are here to help each other grow and succeed. We are excited to have you join us!
